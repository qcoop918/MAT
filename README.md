Microservices Aggregate Testbench (MAT)

In my thesis I refer to this as the Microservice Response Time Testbench (MRTT), just felt that it was more direct.

You may notice there are 4 microservices here, WriteReadDelete is depreciated due to the responsetimes failing to scale linearly.

This is all installed on the 203 server, simply run 'docker compose restart' in the MAT directory.
